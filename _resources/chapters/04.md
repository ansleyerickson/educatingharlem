### Discussion Questions

1. Educating Harlem co-editor Ernest Morrell studies critical media literacy, which he defines as "the consumption, production, and distribution of print and new media texts by, with, and on behalf of marginalized populations in the interests of naming, exposing, and destabilizing power relations; and promoting individual freedom and expression" (2007). How does this chapter relate to that concept?

2. In chapter 4, authors Craig Kridel and Lisa Rabin write, "Teachers often saw film as a way to recognize and interrogate oppression and racism, topics on which the traditional curriculum was silent or even racist itself." In what ways are the curricula you have encountered silent or racist? What films or books, or teaching practices, could recognize and interrogate oppression and racism?
