>> In 1963, HARYOU published *Harlem Youth Report #5: Youth in the Ghetto*, a comic book that was meant to communicate about its Harlem Associates program and recruit other participants. The comic describes HARYOU’s early years and the ways that it engaged youth in social science research, generating knowledge that contributed to the building of HARYOU and to the organization’s widely-circulated 1964 report on conditions in Harlem.

### Discussion Questions

1. In this chapter, author Ansley Erickson writes that HARYOU "created an educational space that developed young people as agents in the advancement of their communities." Have you experienced any formal or informal educational spaces that serve a similar purpose today? How does their approach to youth leadership and learning compare to HARYOU's?

2. Read [Harlem Youth Report #5: Youth In the Ghetto and the Blueprint for Change](https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/files/original/7683c3c4b6200a17338379330416977e.pdf){:target="_blank"}, the comic book that HARYOU produced in 1963 to communicate about its youth researchers and recruit other participants. On the opening page, it lists five elements of HARYOU's pledge to the community. Do you think that the programs described in chapter 7 and in the comic book met these goals? Why or why not? How do these goals resonate – or not – with your hopes for your community today?
