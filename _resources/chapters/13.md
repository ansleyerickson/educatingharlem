### Discussion Questions

1. Read these recent articles on the need for more Black and Latinx teachers from [Chalkbeat](https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2019/11/5/21109162/nyc-has-the-most-diverse-teaching-force-in-the-state-but-it-still-doesn-t-match-the-student-body){:target="_blank"}, [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/local/education/teacher-diversity/){:target="_blank"}, and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/07/08/889112818/what-it-would-take-to-get-an-effective-anti-racist-education){:target="_blank"}. What does the historical perspective given in chapter 13 add to this conversation?

2. In chapter 13, authors Bethany Rogers and Terrenda White discuss the changing definitions and lack of consensus on "teacher quality." How have debates about "teacher quality" shown up in Harlem schools? With what impact? How would you define quality teaching today?
