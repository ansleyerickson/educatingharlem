"The Controversy Over I.S. 201" (1966) (link coming soon)
>> This article by Preston Wilcox was printed in the Urban Review in 1966. Wilcox, a sociologist and community organizer involved in the I.S. 201 boycott, proposed that a committee of parents and community members be given control over the school. This idea was enacted through the Ford Foundation’s demonstration district experiment in 1967.

### Discussion Questions

1. In chapter 8, author Marta Gutman highlights the significance of architectural features such as windows, air conditioning, and the arrangement of classrooms. What do these features say about how the architects or the Board of Education thought about IS 201 students? How did students "turn the architectural logic of the building inside out"? What is the "architectural logic" of your own current or past schools?

2. How does this chapter's discussion of IS 201 compare to other descriptions of education and civil rights activism that you have read? How were community members motivated by both integration and Black autonomy?
