### Discussion Questions

1. What are the most common images or stories that you associate with the phrase "Black Power"? How does author Russell Rickford's description of the Black Power educational landscape align with or differ from those images or stories?

2. Rickford helps readers see how Black activists imagined educational spaces that aligned with and would help them achieve their broader social and political goals. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYJ6d66xGA8){:target="_blank"}, educators respond to the question, "What are schools like in Wakanda?," playing off of the fictional 2018 film Black Panther to encourage expansive thinking about what is possible in education. What do the video, and Rickford's chapter, suggest about the power of imagining and working towards new visions of education in Harlem or beyond?
