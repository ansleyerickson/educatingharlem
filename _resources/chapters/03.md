### Discussion Questions

1. In chapter 3, author Kimberly Johnson describes the demographic changes at Wadleigh in the 1930s and 1940s. These shifts were accompanied by tensions around curriculum and teaching, segregation within the school, and racism experienced by Black girls at the school. Many of [Wadleigh High School's yearbooks](https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/wad_yb){:target="_blank"} are available online. Browse the [1931](https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/items/show/2080){:target="_blank"} and [1943](https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/items/show/2079){:target="_blank"} books and see what similarities and differences you notice. What could a yearbook tell us about this time in the school's life? What do you think is missing from the yearbook's depiction of the school.

2. In an article from 1937, the *New York Times* reported on a speech given by former associate superintendent Dr. John L. Tildsley at a lunch at the Hotel Astor. Tildsley advocated for moving Wadleigh High School away from 114th Street because the students “have to pass through a neighborhood where gentlewomen do not like to pass.” [Read this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u4RRkMWZCoz0fLpTEnhd9U-GHWDEDlFJ/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} critique in the *Amsterdam News* and consider the following questions: Who is a gentlewomen? What views of the neighborhood were expressed by the *New York Times* and the *Amsterdam News* in their coverage of the event?
