### Discussion Questions

1. Browse [these primary sources](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iVLsbcUakEZ89c20BInB9vp6jdSs_d_N/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} from The Modern School, kept by students who attended in the 1950s and 1960s. How do these sources align with or diverge from the impression of the Modern School you got from the chapter?

2. What new information did you learn about the Harlem Renaissance? How does this chapter's discussion of the Harlem Renaissance compare to others that you have read?

3. Educators often contrast "constructivist" modes of learning, where students build knowledge through experience and inquiry, with "direct instruction," where teachers present knowledge for students to absorb. How did Renaissance educators depict these modes of learning? How did they relate to one another? How did the experiences of Black Americans at the time shape these ideas about education?
