["Segregated Schools in Integrated Neighborhoods"](http://www.centernyc.org/segregatedschools){:target="_blank"}

>> This map from the New School’s Center for New York City Affairs addresses school choice through analysis of racial and economic segregation in schooling and housing. It uses data from 2014-2015 and finds that schools in some areas of New York City are more segregated than those areas’ housing because parents are choosing to send their children to schools in other neighborhoods. The authors conclude that integration may not require changing school assignments, but could be achieved by reducing school choice.

### Discussion Questions

1. How does Babette Edwards's story compare to other accounts of the history of school choice that you've heard (including the resources on charter schools above)? Who is the focus of those stories? What are their arguments for or against school choice? How does adding Edwards' story change how you think about school choice?

2. Babette Edwards has been an activist for Harlem children and families across her entire life. In [this piece](https://www.gothamcenter.org/blog/a-love-letter-to-babette-edwards-harlems-othermother){:target="_blank"}, Terri N. Watson describes Edwards as a Harlem "othermother," a Black woman caring for the children of her broader community as if they were her own. Who are the "othermothers" in your school community? What do they want your schools to do for their children?
