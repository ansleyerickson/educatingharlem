["Reconnection for Learning: A Community School System for New York City Schools," pages i-iv (1967)](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED013287){:target="_blank"}

>> This report edited by McGeorge Bundy proposed a plan for a community system in New York City that led to the city’s experiment with decentralization in three districts in 1967. This came after years of activism pushing for community control of New York City public schools. As discussed in chapter 10, the Bundy report recommended that hiring be put under local control. Pages i-iv contain the preface and a summary of the report’s recommendations (please refer to the page numbers on the bottom right of each page, as some pages are scanned out of order).

This proposal for the program outlines Audrey Cohen’s vision, including a partnership with schools. The video, of a feature on the Women’s Talent Corps, includes footage following a paraprofessional at her school and at home.

["Organizing Paraprofessionals" (1977) and Discussion Questions](http://lawcha.org//wp-content/uploads/AFT-Organizing-Paraprofessionals-1973.pdf){:target="_blank"}

>> In 1969, paraprofessional educators in New York City voted to join the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), despite having crossed picket lines to teach during the UFT’s strike in 1968. They hoped their affiliation would help to professionalize their jobs and bring more Black and Latinx leadership to the union, though there was tension in the power differential between teachers and paraprofessionals. This pamphlet from the American Federation of Teachers (with which UFT is affiliated) describes the AFT’s philosophy on organizing paraprofessionals and how they fit into the structure of the union. See the “related document” section at the bottom for a set of discussion questions.

### Discussion Questions

1. Chapter 10 highlights one example of how parents have been involved in facilitating their children's education. Why do you think it was important for parents to serve as paraprofessionals? Considering this narrative alongside other chapters in Educating Harlem (for example, chapters 2, 6, 8, and 12), how have parents contributed to schooling in Harlem? What obstacles have they faced in having these contributions recognized?

2. Read these two articles from 1970 reflecting on the paraprofessional program. [Cleo Silvers](https://voices.revealdigital.org/?a=d&d=BHGIICH19700901.1.55&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1){:target="_blank"}, a former paraprofessional educator and a member of the Harlem branch of the Black Panther Party and the Young Lords, and [Bayard Rustin](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jufzglIcYDYrBWLpaKKrmuTIQvcEI1B0/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, a civil rights and labor leader writing in the Amsterdam News, present very different pictures of the role. Why do you think they differ in their understanding of the opportunities the work provided?
