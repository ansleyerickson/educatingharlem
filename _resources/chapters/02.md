### Discussion Questions

1. Versions of the curricular debates that chapter 2 describes have occurred in many different moments in US and African American history. Perhaps the most famous debate about what Black students should learn in school, and the consequences of curriculum for Black communities and their advancement, took place between W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington at the turn of the 20th century. These texts from [DuBois](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/408/408-h/408-h.htm){:target="_blank"} and [Washington](https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/industrial-education-for-the-negro/){:target="_blank"} argue for different approaches to schooling for African Americans. How is their debate similar to or different from the one underway in Harlem in the 1920s and 1930s?

2. In chapter 2, author Thomas Harbison discusses the residential segregation in Harlem that contributed to and was amplified by segregationist school zoning policies. [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=4/36.71/-97.194&text=intro){:target="_blank"} documents the process of redlining, which helped restrict Black residents to Harlem. Read the website's introduction and find Harlem on the map of [1930s Manhattan](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/40.794/-74.114&city=manhattan-ny){:target="_blank"}. How did discrimination in housing shape Harlem in this time period? With what consequences for its schools, according to Harbison?
