### Discussion Questions

1. In what ways did the visions of teacher activism expressed by the Teachers Union and the Teachers Guild differ? How do the relationships of teachers to students, parents, or communities in the chapter compare to those remembered by Deborah Lucas Davis and Barbara Wilson-Brooks in [these oral history exhibits](https://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/exh). To access the exhibits, select "Learning the Landscape: Deborah Lucas-Davis on Growing Up in Harlem" and "Barbara Wilson-Brooks' Harlem Community."

2. Considering the history of the two unions discussed in chapter 6, what do you think the purpose of a teachers union should be? Explore the current missions of New York City's [United Federation of Teachers](https://www.uft.org/your-union/about-uft/our-mission){:target="_blank"} (UFT) and the UFT's social justice caucus, [Movement Of Rank and File Educators](https://morecaucusnyc.org/mission-statement/){:target="_blank"}. How does each compare to the Teachers Union or the Teachers Guild?
