[The Women’s Talent Corps Proposal (1965)](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED012873){:target="_blank"} and [WNBC Video (4:06-8:57) (1968)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW-5q3bu0rY&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}

>> The Women’s Talent Corps was a job-training institute for women started by Audrey Cohen and funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity. Members of the corps led a successful campaign for the Board of Education to hire paraprofessionals in schools, and they became the first 75 paraprofessional educators hired. This proposal for the program outlines Audrey Cohen’s vision, including a partnership with schools. The video, of a feature on the Women’s Talent Corps, includes footage following a paraprofessional at her school and at home.

["Organizing Paraprofessionals" (1977) and Discussion Questions](http://lawcha.org//wp-content/uploads/AFT-Organizing-Paraprofessionals-1973.pdf){:target="_blank"}

>> In 1969, paraprofessional educators in New York City voted to join the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), despite having crossed picket lines to teach during the UFT’s strike in 1968. They hoped their affiliation would help to professionalize their jobs and bring more Black and Latinx leadership to the union, though there was tension in the power differential between teachers and paraprofessionals. This pamphlet from the American Federation of Teachers (with which UFT is affiliated) describes the AFT’s philosophy on organizing paraprofessionals and how they fit into the structure of the union. See the “related document” section at the bottom for a set of discussion questions.
